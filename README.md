# üõ°Ô∏è DDOS Attack Learning Repository - Cybersecurity Basics

Welcome to the **DDOS Attack Learning Repository**, where you can learn the fundamentals of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks in a safe and controlled environment. This repository is designed for **educational purposes only**, helping beginners understand how DDoS attacks work and how to defend against them.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è DISCLAIMER:** This repository is for educational and research purposes only. Any misuse of the code to harm, disrupt, or attack unauthorized systems is illegal and unethical. By using this repository, you agree to act responsibly and only test in controlled environments with proper authorization.

## üéØ What is a DDOS Attack?

A **Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attack** is a type of cyberattack where multiple systems flood the bandwidth or resources of a targeted server, website, or network. The aim is to overwhelm the target, making it inaccessible to legitimate users.

### **How It Works:**
1. **Attack Initiation:** Multiple devices (often compromised by malware) generate a massive amount of traffic.
2. **Overloading Resources:** The target system‚Äôs bandwidth or computing resources are overwhelmed.
3. **Denial of Service:** Legitimate users cannot access the service, leading to disruptions.

### **Why Learn About DDoS?**
Understanding DDoS attacks is crucial for:
- Building secure systems.
- Learning mitigation strategies (e.g., rate limiting, firewalls).
- Strengthening your knowledge of cybersecurity fundamentals.

## üåü Features of This Repository

1. **Script for Simulating DDoS-Like Behavior**:
   - Opens multiple browser tabs to simulate a resource overload.
   - Provides a defense mechanism to stop the simulation.

2. **Interactive Defense Mechanism**:
   - After a minute, a popup window allows users to enter a defense code (`leavemealone`) to stop the simulation.
   - Displays a countdown timer in the popup.

3. **Automatic Browser Closure**:
   - On successful defense, all opened browser tabs/windows are automatically closed.

4. **Beginner-Friendly Guide**:
   - Step-by-step instructions for running the program.
   - Detailed explanation of the code.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

1. **Python 3.10+ Installed**:
   - Download Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

2. **Install Required Libraries**:
   Run the following command to install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install psutil pillow
   ```

3. **Controlled Environment**:
   - Use a virtual machine or isolated network for testing.

---

### **Steps to Run the Program**

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone [https://github.com/your-username/ddos-attack-learning.git](https://github.com/DularaAbhiranda/DDOS-attack.git)
   cd ddos-attack
   ```

2. **Activate the Virtual Environment (Optional)**:
   Create and activate a virtual environment for isolated testing:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .\.venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   source .venv/bin/activate   # On macOS/Linux
   ```

3. **Run the Program**:
   Execute the Python script to start the simulation:
   ```bash
   python script.py
   ```

4. **Observe Behavior**:
   - Browser tabs will start opening continuously.
   - After 1 minute, a popup window will appear asking for the defense code.

5. **Stop the Attack**:
   - Enter the defense code `leavemealone` in the popup window.
   - A success message, "You are safe now!" will appear.
   - All browser windows will close automatically.

6. **Incorrect Code**:
   - If you enter the wrong code, the popup will display "Try again," and the attack will resume.

## üõ†Ô∏è Building a Standalone Application

To convert the Python script into a standalone executable for easy sharing:

1. **Install PyInstaller**:
   ```bash
   pip install pyinstaller
   ```

2. **Package the Script**:
   ```bash
   python -m PyInstaller --onefile --noconsole --icon=app_icon.ico script.py
   ```

3. **Find the Executable**:
   The final executable will be in the `dist` folder:
   ```plaintext
   dist/script.exe
   ```

4. **Run the Executable**:
   Double-click the `script.exe` file to run the application.
