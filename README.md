# DDoS Attack Learning Repository

Welcome to the **DDoS Attack Learning Repository**. This repository is designed for educational purposes, focusing on understanding Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks, their mechanisms, and defensive strategies.

> **⚠️ Disclaimer:** This repository is intended for educational and research purposes only. Any misuse of the content to harm, disrupt, or attack any system or network without proper authorization is illegal and unethical. By using this repository, you agree to act responsibly and only test on systems you own or have explicit permission to test.

## Contents
- **Scripts**: Python scripts demonstrating controlled DDoS attack simulations and defensive mechanisms.
- **Explanation**: Documentation explaining the theory, mechanisms, and impact of DDoS attacks.
- **Defensive Strategies**: Built-in tools to test and mitigate the simulated attacks.
- **Lab Setup**: Instructions for setting up a local lab environment to safely experiment and learn.

## Features of the Final Script

1. **Tab Opening with Intervals**:
   - Continuously opens web browser tabs for a specified duration (1-minute intervals).

2. **Interactive Defense Mechanism**:
   - After each interval, a popup window allows the user to enter a defense code (`leavemealone`) to stop the attack.
   - A countdown timer in the popup window reduces from 30 seconds, giving the user time to respond.

3. **Automatic Program Termination**:
   - If the correct code is entered, the script stops running and displays a success message: "You are safe now!"
   - Automatically closes all browser windows (e.g., Chrome, Firefox) on successful defense.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - If an incorrect code is entered, the popup displays an error message and resumes the attack.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/ddos-attack-learning.git
   cd ddos-attack-learning
   ```

2. **Run the Script**:
   Ensure all dependencies are installed. Then execute the script:
   ```bash
   python script_name.py
   ```

3. **Stop the Attack**:
   - Wait for the popup window to appear.
   - Enter the defense code `leavemealone` to stop the attack.

4. **Observe Behavior**:
   - Monitor the system's performance during the attack.
   - Analyze the defensive mechanism in action.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.x installed on your system.
- Required Python packages:
  ```bash
  pip install psutil
  ```
- A controlled environment (e.g., virtual machine, isolated network) for testing.
